Description: Functions to load Research Patient Data Registry ('RPDR') text queries from Partners Healthcare institutions into R.
             The package also provides helper functions to manipulate data and execute common procedures
             such as finding the closest radiological exams considering a given timepoint. 'parseRPDR' currently supports
             txt sources: "mrn", "con", "dem", "enc", "rdt", "lab", "med", "dia", "rfv", "prc", "phy", "lno",
             "car", "dis", "end", "hnp", "opn", "pat", "prg", "pul", "rad" and "vis".
             All functionalities are parallelized for fast and efficient analyses.
